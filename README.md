# Welcome

I'm [Dorian](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dorianjagusch), a former evolutionary biologist who has transitioned into the world of coding. I'm very passionate about diving into the depths of the digital realm, with a particular focus on networking and communication, graphics, data science, and dabbling in full-stack development.

## About Me

- 🌱🐟 **Scientific Origins**: With a background in evolutionary biology, I've spent years deciphering the intricate mechanisms of life's evolution. This background has honed my analytical thinking and instilled a profound appreciation for complexity.

- 👾💻 **Coding Enthusiast**: My journey into the world of coding has been nothing short of exhilarating. The challenge of solving intricate problems and the vast canvas for creative expression that coding provides are what drive me. I have a keen interest in data science, utilizing data to derive meaningful insights and patterns. I'm also currently exploring the realm of full-stack development.

- 🌿🎮 **Interests**: When I am not in school or not coding in my free-time, I spend my time taking care of my house plant collection, solving variant sudokus or just enjoying the good stuff in life like game nights, video games, movies, books, music etc. 🤓

## Notable Projects

Here are some of the projects I'm currently engaged in or have completed:

- **[MiniRT](https://github.com/dorianjagusch/miniRT)**: A project where we delved into the world of computer graphics, implementing a ray tracing engine, achieving stunning visual effects.

- **[Ft_irc](https://github.com/dorianjagusch/ft_irc)**: A project focusing on creating an IRC (Internet Relay Chat) server and client, emphasizing network programming and communication protocols.

- **[Minishell](https://github.com/dorianjagusch/minishell/)**: An exploration into shell scripting, where we designed and implemented a simple shell from scratch, offering command execution and other shell functionalities.
 
- **[Philosophers](https://github.com/dorianjagusch/philo/)**: A fascinating journey into the world of synchronization and multithreading. This project challenges you to simulate the Dining Philosophers problem, guiding you to create a program that allows philosophers to think, eat, and avoid conflicts or deadlocks in a shared dining environment. 

## Get in Touch

I'm always keen to connect with fellow developers, whether they're seasoned professionals or fellow newcomers embarking on their coding journey. Reach out to me through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dorian-jagusch). Collaboration, knowledge exchange, and constructive dialogues are always welcome.

## Let's Code Together

If you share a passion for coding, graphics, data science, or full-stack development, or if you're intrigued by the unique blend of biology and coding, I invite you to explore my repositories, provide feedback, or even contemplate collaboration on a project. 🚀

Thank you for visiting, and here's to a future filled with productive coding! 🖥️📊🌐
