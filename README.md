## About Me

- **Scientific Origins**: With a background in evolutionary biology, I've spent years deciphering the intricate mechanisms of life's evolution. This background has honed my analytical thinking and instilled a profound appreciation for complexity.

- **Coding Enthusiast**: My journey into the world of coding has been nothing short of exhilarating. The challenge of solving intricate problems and the vast canvas for creative expression that coding provides are what drive me.

- **Interests**: In addition to my graphics and low-level programming pursuits, I have a keen interest in data science, utilizing data to derive meaningful insights and patterns. Furthermore, I'm currently exploring the realm of full-stack development, bridging the gap between the front-end and back-end aspects of web applications.

## Notable Projects

Here are some of the projects I'm currently engaged in or have completed:

- **[MiniRT (School 42)](https://github.com/dorianjagusch/miniRT)**: A project where we delved into the world of computer graphics, implementing a ray tracing engine, achieving stunning visual effects.

- **[ft_irc (School 42)](https://github.com/dorianjagusch/ft_irc)**: A project focusing on creating an IRC (Internet Relay Chat) server and client, emphasizing network programming and communication protocols.

- **[Minishell (School 42)](https://github.com/dorianjagusch/minishell/)**: An exploration into shell scripting, where we designed and implemented a simple shell from scratch, offering command execution and other shell functionalities.

- **Path Algorithm Visualizer**: Currently, I'm working on a path algorithm visualizer project. This full-stack endeavor combines my passion for coding with my interest in data science to create a tool that visually represents and analyzes pathfinding algorithms.

## Get in Touch
